# No Hebrew in Code or Comments

- **Never** add Hebrew text in source code comments (e.g. `//`, `/* */`, `/** */`). Use English only.
- **Never** add Hebrew in commit messages, JSDoc, or any developer-facing strings in the codebase.
- User-facing UI strings (labels, buttons, placeholders, error messages shown to end users) may remain in any language the product uses; this rule applies only to **comments and developer-facing text**.
- When editing or adding comments, always write them in English.
